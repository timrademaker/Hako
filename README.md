# Hako
 Content packer or something


# Optional Defines
## HAKO_READ_OUTSIDE_OF_ARCHIVE
When defined, Hako will try to find files outside of the archive before checking if the file exists inside the archive.
This prevents the need to rebuild the entire archive every time you want to test a change to a file.
